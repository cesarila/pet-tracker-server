## Pet Status Tracker
This project was created to give my family members a way to keep track of which cats are inside and outside at any given time. Unlike paper cards near the door which aren't visible from other areas of the house, everyone connected to our home network can access this page and see who is where.

### Limitations
There is no automated way of detecting cats going inside and outside. The data is only as good as our willingness to update it.

### Personal Goals
In making this project, I learned about the Go programming language and refreshed myself with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
